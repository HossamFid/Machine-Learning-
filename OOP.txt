the class creates the object 

class is the defination , object is the actual thing that u work with inside ur code


class in the house blueprint(مخطط)  ===> instantiation ===> house1 , house2 etc.... (objects)


cuz objects themselves are made of 2 things state and behavior : 

object  state - properties - variables (update the defualt class variables)
object behavior - funtionality - functions (that is the thing they can do) 

class Circle:		    # class 		
	raduis = 0;
	
	def circum(self):
		return 3.141 * 2 * self.raduis 

circleA = Circle()      # objects 
circleA.radius = 15 

circleB = Circle()
circleB.radius = 11  



A constructor is a special kind of method that Python calls when it instantiates an object using the definitions found in your class. Python relies on the constructor to perform tasks .
such as initializing (assigning values to) any instance variables that the object will need when it starts.
